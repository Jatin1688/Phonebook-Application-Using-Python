# Phonebook Application ðŸ“ž

This is a simple, interactive Phonebook Application built with Python. The application allows users to manage a personal contact list with ease, performing essential actions like adding, searching, deleting, and listing contacts.

## Features

- **Add a New Contact**: Easily add contacts by entering a name and phone number. If the contact already exists, the application will notify you.
- **Search for a Contact**: Quickly search for any contact by name and get the associated phone number.
- **Delete a Contact**: Remove any contact by name, with a message confirming the deletion.
- **List All Contacts**: View a complete list of saved contacts, displayed in a user-friendly format.
- **Exit**: Close the application gracefully.

This project reinforces core Python skills, especially in handling dictionaries, conditional statements, and basic user interface design.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the `phonebook.py` file.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `phonebook.py`.

### Running the Application

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python phonebook.py
```

This will launch the Phonebook Application and display a menu where you can choose an action by entering the corresponding number.

## Project Structure

- **phonebook.py**: This is the main script file containing the applicationâ€™s code. It defines the functions for adding, searching, deleting, and listing contacts, as well as a main loop to display the menu and take user input.

## How It Works

The application uses a Python dictionary to store contact information, where each contactâ€™s name is the key and their phone number is the value. This structure enables efficient lookups, additions, deletions, and listings of contacts. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` check ensures that the application runs only when executed directly, allowing the code to be reusable as a module if needed.

### Functions Overview

- **add_contact()**: Prompts the user for a name and phone number, adds the contact if it doesn't already exist.
- **search_contact()**: Searches for a contact by name and displays the phone number if found.
- **delete_contact()**: Deletes a contact by name if it exists in the phonebook.
- **list_contacts()**: Lists all contacts in the phonebook with names and phone numbers.

## Usage Example

1. Run the application.
2. Choose an action from the menu:
   - Press **1** to add a new contact.
   - Press **2** to search for an existing contact.
   - Press **3** to delete a contact.
   - Press **4** to list all contacts.
   - Press **5** to exit the application.

## Project Goals

This project is designed as a learning tool to practice basic Python skills, focusing on:
- Using dictionaries for data storage.
- Implementing conditional logic for user actions.
- Structuring code with functions for better readability and reusability.
  
## License

This project is free to use and modify. Feel free to enhance or customize the code according to your needs.
